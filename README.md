# Dolby.io Communications SDK for React Native

The Dolby.io Communications APIs provide a platform for unified communications and collaboration. You can combine voice, video, and messaging as an integrated solution for your own applications in a way that is cohesive to your end-users. This is in contrast to out-of-app communications where users must exit your application and turn to third-party stand-alone tools.

For example, with the Client SDKs you can build:

- A video conference application for your employee portal
- A broadcast webinar application for presentations to grow your audience
- A 1-on-1 help desk service for your specialized customers

## Requirements

### iOS

- Xcode 12 and iOS SDK 14
- iOS 11.0+ target deployment

### Android

- Minimum Android SDK version - 25

## Installation

1. Install module using `npm` or `yarn`:

   ```bash
   npm install @dolbyio/react-native-comms-sdk --save
   ```

   ```bash
   yarn add @dolbyio/react-native-comms-sdk
   ```

2. If you are using React Native version 0.60 or later:

- for IOS: install native dependencies via CocoaPods from your /ios directory:

  ```bash
  pod install --repo-update
  ```

- for Android: add following lines to your `android/build.grade` file:
  ```
   maven { url("http://android-sdk.voxeet.com/release") }
   maven { url("http://android-sdk.voxeet.com/beta") }
  ```
  and also add following lines to your `android/app/build.gradle` file:
  ```
  packagingOptions {
     pickFirst '**/armeabi-v7a/libc++_shared.so'
     pickFirst '**/x86/libc++_shared.so'
     pickFirst '**/arm64-v8a/libc++_shared.so'
     pickFirst '**/x86_64/libc++_shared.so'
  }
  ```

3. If you are using a React Native version prior to 0.60, link the native dependency:

   ```bash
   react-native link @dolbyio/react-native-comms-sdk
   ```

   Then, install from your /ios directory:

   ```bash
   pod install --repo-update
   ```

4. Follow the iOS and Android getting started pages to configure native projects.
   https://docs.dolby.io/communications-apis/docs/create-a-basic-audio-conference-application-for-ios
   https://docs.dolby.io/communications-apis/docs/android-create-basic-audio-conference

## Getting started

1. Import the SDK to your project.

```js
import CommsAPI from '@dolbyio/react-native-comms-sdk';
```

2. Initialize the SDK with your Dolby.io credentials.

```js
await CommsAPI.initialize(APP_ID, APP_SECRET);
```

3. Open a session.

```js
await CommsAPI.session.open({ name, externalId });
```

4. Create a conference.

```js
const conferenceOptions = {
  alias,
  params: {},
};

const createdConference = await CommsAPI.conference.create(
  conferenceOptions
);
```

4. Join the created conference.

```js
const joinedConference = await CommsAPI.conference.join(
  createdConference,
  {}
);
```

5. Import some additional services.

```js
import { Conference } from '@dolbyio/react-native-comms-sdk';
```

or

```js
import CommsAPI from '@dolbyio/react-native-comms-sdk';
const { Conference } = CommsAPI;
```

## Integrate video

1. Place the VideoView in your component.

```jsx
import { VideoView } from '@dolbyio/react-native-comms-sdk';
...
return (
...
  <VideoView
    style={{ flex: 1 }}
  />
```

2. Get a reference to your VideoView component.

```jsx
const videoView = useRef() as React.MutableRefObject<VideoView>;
...
return (
...
  <VideoView
    style={{ flex: 1 }}
    ref={videoView}
  />
```

3. Attach a stream to video.

```js
videoView.current.attach(
  participant,
  participant.streams[participant.streams.length - 1]
);
```

VideoView properties

| Name      | Type            | Description                                                                 |
| --------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| isMirror  | boolean         | It allows the image to be reflected horizontally                            |
| scaleType | 'fit' or 'fill' | It allows you to fit the image differently to the canvas                    |
| style     |                 | It allows you to style the video window according to React Native standards |

VideoView methods

| Name              | Arguments                                           | Returns          | Description                                                        |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| attach()          | (participant: Participant,mediaStream: MediaStream) | Promise(boolean) | Allows displaying the stream of participant                        |
| detach()          | none                                                | Promise(boolean) | It allows you to finish displaying the stream                      |
| isAttached()      | none                                                | Promise(boolean) | Gets information about whether the stream is active                |
| isScreenSharing() | none                                                | Promise(boolean) | Gets information about whether the active stream is screen-sharing |

## Documentation

A complete list of available services in SDK along with method documentation

[CommsAPI](classes/CommsAPI.md)
is the main module that allows the application to interact with DolbyIo services. The SDK is asynchronous and uses promise at its core.

[CommandService](classes/internal.CommandService.md)
allows the application to send text messages or notifications to all conference participants. The service also emits an received event to inform the application about received messages.

[ConferenceService](classes/internal.ConferenceService.md)
allows the application to manage the conference life-cycle and interact with the conference.

[FilePresentationService](classes/internal.FilePresentationService.md)
allows the application to manage the conference life-cycle and interact with the conference.

[MediaDeviceService](classes/internal.MediaDeviceService.md)
allows the application to manage media devices that are used during conferences.

[NotificationService](classes/internal.NotificationService.md)
enables inviting participants to a conference.

[RecordingService](classes/internal.RecordingService.md)
allows an application to record conferences by using the start and stop
methods that turn the recording on and off.

[SessionService](classes/internal.SessionService.md)
allows opening and closing sessions. Opening a session is mandatory before interacting with any service.

[VideoPresentationService](classes/internal.VideoPresentationService.md)
allows sharing videos during a conference.
